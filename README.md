# DIY-Sim-Racing-GT-Steering-Wheel

NOTE: This wheel project is still in concept status. All the ideas haven’t been tested. If you would like to make something similar, please take that in consideration!

## Overview
This wheel is designed to be easy to modify, test new ideas and easy to assemble.  
This is an open source project, with the intent to be shared and improved with mods, so we can all enjoy the hardware that fits our specific needs!

## Main components

### Frame:
The most important and expensive part of the wheel is the structure. Because of that, this should not be required to change and to be upgradable (design should accommodate for different mods).  
The structure is designed to be made of carbon fiber/Aluminium sheet, assembled with “tab and slot” technique. (concept needs to be proven)

### Grips/Button Box/Shift paddles/etc:
Get creative, this is the reason for this project! Make your own grip, change color, add buttons, print with different materials!!!  
Make different button boxes. Add screens, add/remove buttons.  
Use of the shelf components from other brands, if needed. Like shifter paddles.

## Remarks:
This wheel is designed to fit my needs. The distance from the QR to the grip, is specific to my setup.  
The 3d model in Onshape is designed with input variables, with the intention to make it easy to modify on the fly and output a finished model that will fit your requirements (this is my aim!).
